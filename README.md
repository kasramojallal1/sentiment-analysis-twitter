# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter

Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Explore sentiment in tweets using BERT, RNN, and LSTM models. This project delves into effective natural language processing, comparing model performances on Twitter and 'Sentiment140' datasets. Uncover insights and trends in social media sentiments.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets using various advanced models such as BERT, RNN, and LSTM. It involves preprocessing tweet data, training the models, and evaluating their performance on different datasets.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw tweet data is preprocessed to make it suitable for model training. This includes steps like converting text to lowercase, removing URLs, punctuation, numbers, and stopwords.

2. **Model Training**: Three different models (BERT, RNN, and LSTM) are trained on the preprocessed data to perform sentiment analysis. Each model's architecture and training process are optimized for the best performance.

3. **Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated on two datasets - Twitter and Sentiment140. The performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Comparison**: The performance of the three models is compared to identify which model works best for Twitter sentiment analysis.

## Results

The results of this project provide insights into which model performs best for sentiment analysis on tweets. Key outcomes include:

- **Model Performance**: Detailed performance metrics for BERT, RNN, and LSTM models.
- **Insights and Trends**: Analysis of sentiment trends in the Twitter and Sentiment140 datasets.
- **Best Model**: Identification of the model with the highest performance for Twitter sentiment analysis.
